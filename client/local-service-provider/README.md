### Explanation:
1. **Structure**: The structure mirrors the Homepage, maintaining consistency in design.
2. **Contact Information**: Demo contact information is provided, including a phone number, email, and address.
3. **Styling**: The same classes are used for styling to ensure the Contact page matches the overall theme of the application.
4. **Button**: A button is included for users to send a message, which can be linked to a contact form or email functionality later.

You can place this `Contact.tsx` file in the appropriate directory of your Next.js application (usually in the `pages` directory) to make it accessible as a route.
